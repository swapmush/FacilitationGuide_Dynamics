## Session: Modeling

### Key Idea Icon
* Understand how model simulations provide a means to make mental models more explicit and test assumptions, particularly surrounding implementation plans.
* Assist stakeholders in evaluating implementation plans by using model simulation to visualize dynamic relationships 
* Increase stakeholder EBP-specific capacity by understanding the impact of system factors, such as intake referral rate, on the level of state measures, such as amount of patients pending intake scheduling.


### Definitions- Book Icon

* Static Observation/Stock 
    +  The level or prevalence of a variables at any given time (e.g., number of patients on any given day pending any service)
* Dynamic Observation
    +  Refer to Swapâ€™s definitions
* Flows
     + Increase or decrease a stock over time (e.g., rate at which patients are being referred)
* Feedback
     +  Information about the state of a system, usually after an action that caused some changes
     +  Positive feedback loop - AKA Reinforcing loop- variables reinforce each other leading to increased growth or decline
     +  Negative feedback loop- Variables counteract, creating a balanced state

### Dialogue- Hexagon Icon

* Discuss Icebreaker Exercises- Traffic Jam/Flow 
* Briefly describe relate this to stocks and flows
* Data dialogue- what variables are currently measured? What factors are driving the rates of those variables?

### Learning Loop (Practice/ Exercise)

* Group model building exercise (Use current data, create model? Show a model?)
    
## Hexagon Molecule (Lesson Overview) "Putting it Together"

* The main role of simulation is to test hypotheses about the relationship between the system structure and system behavior using local data and local expertise.
