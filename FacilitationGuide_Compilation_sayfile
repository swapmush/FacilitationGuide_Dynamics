## Session: Dynamics, Session 1

### Key Ideas 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_star_778913_003F72.svg">

* Employees are willing to perform and provide quality work, but their success is directly tied to and limited by the nature of the system they are working in. 
* Quality improvement strategies and provider morale are closely linked. 
* it is important to directly engage frontline staff in a co-learning process that understands tradeoffs in the system (e.g., outcomes and burnout) and maximizes the functioning of the whole system. 

### Terms

* Dynamic hypothesis  
* Trade Off
* General Quality Improvement Capacity
* EBP Specific Capacity

### Dialogue

## Lesson Overview "Putting it Together"		
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_molecule_784555_003F72.svg>

* The greater the interdependence of the system, the greater the need for learning and coordination. In order to model to learn, we need participation and to elicit mental models and make them explicit 
* The data used in this approach emerge out of the interactions of the whole system. Want stakeholders to see the whole system behavior and its parts in new ways. Want them to be able to zoom in and zoom out.

* Coming Up



### Narrative

## Quality Improvement Efforts Often Fail 

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_remove-team_476525_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

“How many of you have ever felt frustrated that they system would not let you do your work? What agency did you feel like you had to change that? How many of you have had data or numbers used for performance improvement initiatives? How were the data used?"

Often, previously used QI strategies and data may not feel valid or useful because they do not address the fundamental dynamics at play in the system. There can be significant side effects to selecting an ineffective QI strategy, including policy resistance, burnout, etc. Data can also be used to punish or reward, which can lead to policy resistance, and does not make sense if the data don't address the full dynamics of the system. Not only can QI be difficult because of the impact it has on individuals within the system, the system itself can also be resistant to change. In this approach, we view success as being directly tied to and limited by the system you are working in. Does anyone remember what we learned from the idea of the slinky? (Structure determines behavior).

## Success is Dependent on the System 

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_full-network_674171_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Many quality improvement efforts that are selected fail because they lead to policy resistance, burnout, turnover, low morale, etc. These approaches are unsuccessful because they do not take into account the fundamental dynamics at play in the system. They fail to take into account the feedback in the system, in other words, what effect the effort will have on providers, and how that will then impact the success of the initiative.

## Measuring Performance

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_team_981174_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

When we talk about success in an initiative, it's important to also discuss how success is measured. How performance is measured can vary by the type of team you are on. For example, if we were part of a bowling team our performance is defined by our individual scores that get added to the team score. If we are part of a band, though, our performance is determined by how we play together. We want to think about our performance as if we were a band. Thinking about how a whole system functions together may be a very different approach than what has previously been done with performance measures, etc, when data can be used against providers. 
 
## Alternative Approach

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_idea_884671_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">
In this approach, we will take a totally different approach, with a focus on learning together and prioritizing the things that frontline staff care most about. 

## Zooming in and out 

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_collapse_926266_000000%20(1).svg width="240" height="180"> 
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_view_926267_000000.svg width="240" height="180">

To do this, we will need to be able to look at data in a way that is not punishing. This is different than how data are often used. For example, we may think data looks very clear – think “bad numbers” v “good numbers” – but that may not be providing the information we think it is and we might miss important information if we just look at a snapshot of the data.  So we need to look at the whole system that you are working in - zooming in to look at specific pieces of the picture but also zooming out to make sure we zoom out to optimize parts in terms of the whole.

## Tradeoffs

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_team_981174_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_settings_339117_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_hospital_547435_0083BE.svg width="240" height="180">
 
In order to understanding the effect of a change initative in the whole system functioning we need to understand tradeoffs. For example, the tradeoff between a quality improvement strategy selected and how this strategy impacts staff (which will of course then feedback and impact the success of the quality improvement strategy). Given the interdependencies in the system, processes should be optimized in a way that leads to the benefit of the whole system to meet the needs of the Veteran. 

## Increasing general and specific capacity

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_communication_884666_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">
Over the coming weeks, we are going to cover a lot of information that helps us do this. By using this approach, we hope to not only increase the capacity of staff to improve EBP reach, but generally to increase capacity to look at a whole system and make meaningful changes to the system. 

To get started, we are going to start to learn about causal loops, using an example of the feedback between a quality improvement strategy and the effect it has on staff.

 ### Participatory System Dynamics Resources in R Markdown 
This is an R Markdown presentation for the "Initiating and Elaborating a Causal Loop Diagram" learning loop exercise from the participatory learning session of the Team PSD Facilitation Guide. 
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 
We use R and R Markdown so that our materials are open source/free, transparent for collaboration, reproducible by others and can be used repeatedly over time for local sustainability or for adaptation to another local health care system.

### Context
This learning loop exercise is used at the beginning of the project in order to get an initial idea of central concepts and their relationships.  The aim of the participatory system dynamics modeling process is to construct a formal simulation model, therefore it is recommended to build a stock and flow model. 
* When accumulations are important in the issue (e.g., patients flowing through a variety of states in the outpatient mental health system), a stock and flow model is recommended.

### Purpose
* Initiating mapping
* Eliciting relations
* Eliciting feedback loops

### Primary Nature of the Group Task
Convergent

### Time
Preparation time by facilitators: 20 minutes
Stakeholder time required during session: 20 minutes, plus 20 minutes of debriefing

### Matierals Needed
* Three flip charts or wall space on which several flip charts are taped. *OR** Whiteboard, markers and flip chart. *AND/OR** A project and laptop with Vensim. For this last option, a second person will be necessary to draw the diagram that is elicited in Vensim.

### Inputs
A list of variables

### Ouputs
Deliverable:  A causal loop diagram which may be used as a *dynamic hypothesis* on the basis of which formal modeling will build iteratively.  
* There is also an interim output, which is increased consensus regarding the *dynamic hypothesis* or a possible structural explanation for the observed system behavior (e.g., "limited reach of evidence-based practices")

### Roles
- Facilitator/modeler with experience in drawing causl loop diagrams, preferably with experience in building formal models as well- Stakeholders

### Steps to Eliciting a Causal Loop Diagram

#### STEP ONE ####  
The facilitator reminds the learners about the problem variable, preferably sketched as a reference mode of behavior.  Reminder the group of the list of variables elicited before.  Place the list of variables in such a way that it is visible to the group of participants.  Write the problem variable in the centre of the white board or black board.
* Below are examples from the first session of local observational data.

###### Slide with Local Data 
```{r cars, echo = TRUE}summary(cars)```

###### Plot of the Reference Mode for Local System from Local Data
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}plot(pressure)```
###### Alternative plot of the Reference Mode for Local System from an Image

#### STEP TWO ##### 
Build the model by following the three following activities:
1. Ask participants which variable from the collected list is a caus for changes in the problem variable.  When someone makes a suggestion, include this in the drawing of the model in order to visualize what is meant.  Then check to see if everyon eagrees with the proposed relation.  If someone disagrees, ask for clarification and try to determine what the group thinks the relationship should be.  If a discussion goes on too long, you can choose to temporarily 'park' this item and continue with another part of the model.  Hopefully, there will not only be variables that have a direct relationship with the problem variable.  but you will also build a few logical chains of reasoning (via intermediate variables) into the model  In addition, check the polarity (positive or negative) of the relationship.
2. After spending some time doing this, proceed to the consequences of changes in the problem variable.
3. At the point where a feedback chain becomes closed, check with the entire group to see if the chain as a whole is correct. Check again to see if a loopo is positive or negative.  *The **Ratio Exercise** may be used to draw out loops.*

#### STEP THREE ##### 
IN the last part of the session, analyze the model by checking the feedback loops one more time.  Before you clsoe the group session, make sure you do the following.  If there is a list of parked issues, go through them.  State once more what has been done and what will happen with the products of the learning loop exercise in this this lesson and help the stakeholders to see how this fits within the larger participatory system dynamis modeling process.

### Evaluation criteria:
* Improvement in the quality of communication among stakeholders and within teams.* New insights and use of systems thinking* Consensus on the problem * Increasing commitment to the participatory system dynamics modeling effort
